<h1>December 21, 2007</h1>
		<p>
		As tomorrow is the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere it seems fitting to write about the rebirth of Amnesty Hypercube which officially takes place in 2008 with the release of our <a id="out" title="Open link in browser" target="_blank" href="http://www.amnestyhypercube.com">public beta.</a> In the public beta we're introducing a whole new user experience which we believe fulfills the potential of our original vision: a true platform for widget management on the desktop and the web.
		</p><p>The beta brings drag-and-drop simplicity to our alpha preview features.  For example, if you want to convert a web widget for use in OS X Dashboard or Vista Sidebar, you simply pick up the widget and drag it to the target platform's library icon.</p><p>
		The public beta also introduces two new features:
<ul>
<li>the ability to manage not only your web widgets, but also desktop widgets such as those in OS X Dashboard, Vista Sidebar and Yahoo! Widget Engine; and</li>
<li>the ability to move widgets easily between your desktop and Hypercube running on Facebook, Friendster and OpenSocial (Orkut and others).</li>
</ul></p><p>  As we move towards the 1.0 release we'll be introducing enhanced integration with web destinations, expanded web-to-desktop widget conversion  &hellip; and perhaps a few surprises.  </p><p>Finally, we'd like to thank all of you who sent in your feedback as it really helped us focus on the exciting new direction we're moving with the product. Happy New Year!</p>
<p>
P.S.  The alpha preview was originally set to expire at the end of this year, but with today's alpha update we've removed that restriction. </p>
		<h1>October 10, 2007</h1>

		It's been a while since we updated this internal blog, but it's been for a good reason: today
		we're announcing the release of <a id="out" title="Open link in browser" target="_blank" href="http://www.amnestywidgets.com/HypercubeFB.html">Amnesty Hypercube on Facebook</a>.
		</p>		
		<p>This new application marks the first steps towards our goal of unifying the web widget space 		via Hypercube: connecting
		web destinations, such as Facebook with desktops environments, such as Sidebar.  To get
		the ball rolling we are also updating Amnesty Hypercube for Windows to version 0.2.  This minor
		release includes some bug fixes and some under-the-hood changes to prepare for full integration with Hypercube in Facebook.
		</p>

		Windows alpha preview day has arrived!  As with any pre-release, there may be a few issues that crop up, but we're excited to have reached a delivery date with what appears to be a robust and stable build.</p>
		<p>FYI, we define alpha as &quot;not feature complete but could use testing&quot; and beta as &quot;needs  testing before final release.&quot;  Because this is the first  alpha release, there are definitely things that didn't make the cut and are still in development. Here are some cool features to look for in future releases:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Preferences</b>.  These are mostly in place and are just awaiting further UI design.</li><br>
		<li><b>Adding/Removing/Renaming Cubes</b>.  Coming soon, though some of you craftier types might figure out how to do this with current build.</li><br>
		<li><b>Editing Cube Settings</b>.  Including cube background color, image and opacity.</li><br>
		<li><b>Sharing and Publishing Widgets/Cubes</b>.  Widget and cube sharing between Amnesty Hypercube users.  Look for it in the public beta.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A number of these features can be activated in the current build &ndash; see our <a id="in" href="tips.html">Tips &amp; Tricks</a> page in the following weeks.  In the meantime, please send along your bug reports, comments and suggestions.  Your feedback will really help as we move towards a public beta of the Amnesty Hypercube application, web site and community.</p>
