		<p>Welcome to the Amnesty Hypercube alpha preview!</p>
		<p>Amnesty Hypercube is a desktop  application designed to release web widgets and other embeddable web media (such as Flash games and video) from the confines of the browser.</p>
		<p>Amnesty Hypercube is more than just another desktop widget platform &ndash; it
		  actually extends Vista's widget space by allowing you to push web widgets
		  into your  Sidebar with one click. And if you're a web
		  publisher, Amnesty Hypercube is the ideal place to collect, manage
		  and test widgets before adding them to your blog, home page or social
		  networking profile. </p>
	
		<p>You can learn more about each of these features later on.  For now, here are the basics:</p>
		<table>
		<tr><td></td>
		  <td>This full screen mode  is called the <i>Hypercube</i>. The Hypercube
		    is an off-desktop environment where you can open, manage and run
		    widgets, similar to Yahoo! Widget Engine's heads up display.<br /></td>
		</tr>

		<tr><td></td><td>The Hypercube is made up of one or more <i>Cubes</i>, each with its own set of widgets.  Only one Cube may be visible at a time (right now you are in Cube 1).  Use the Control Buttons at the top right of your main monitor to manage widgets inside of the Hypercube.<br /></td></tr>

		<tr><td></td>
		  <td>After you exit the Hypercube and return to your desktop, you can always
		    get back by selecting <b>Enter Hypercube</b> from
		    the Amnesty Hypercube menu, accesible from the cube icon that has
		    been installed in your system tray.<br /></td>
		</tr>

		<tr><td></td><td>In addition, you can open, manage and run widgets directly on your desktop.  Use the Amnesty Hypercube menu to manage widgets outside of the Hypercube.<br /></td></tr>
		
		</table>
		<p><img id="rimage" src="buttons/Help.png">Check out the Info Center for more information about Amnesty Hypercube including detailed Help, FAQs and Known Issues.  The Info Center  also lists which functions are (and are not) available in the alpha preview.  You can access the Info Center by clicking the info control bubble icon in the Hypercube.</p>
		
		<p>By the way, a number of sample widgets will be pre-installed in your Widget
		  Gallery when this window is closed. We'll also go ahead and open one of these
		  widgets in this Cube for you. Close this window to start enjoying the alpha
	    preview. </div>
